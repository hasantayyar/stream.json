As described, this is the geek's home media streaming server, so the only thing that it does is get the video index from `videos.json` and send customized JSON for your client.\r\n\r\nThink of it as a middleware for your HTTP server to make streaming videos more customizable than just directory listings. **:)**\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\n**stream.json** is really easy to setup (for a geek).\r\n\r\n- Create a file called `config.json` inside the `/config` folder. Here's an example (if you want to know more about the configurations file please read [Configuration-File](https://github.com/nathanpc/stream.json/wiki/Configuration-File)):\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"server_port\": 4881,\r\n  \"video_server\": {\r\n    \"local\": true,\r\n    \"ip\": \"\",\r\n    \"port\": 80,\r\n    \"suffix\": \"~Nathan/\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"auth\": {\r\n    \"required\": false,\r\n    \"users\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"username\": \"admin\",\r\n        \"password\": \"admin\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Create a file called `videos.json` in the same folder as `app.js`. This file will hold the index of movies/videos and their informations. Your `videos.json` file should look like this (if you want to know more about the video index file please read [Video-Index-File](https://github.com/nathanpc/stream.json/wiki/Video-Index-File)):\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"video\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"Unique-ID-Here\",\r\n      \"title\": \"Awesome Movie Title Here\",\r\n      \"poster\": \"/path/to/your/poster/LikeThis.jpg\",\r\n      \"file\": \"some_movie_name.mp4\",\r\n      \"description\": {\r\n        \"format\": \"plain\",\r\n        \"text\": \"Your description goes here.\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- You should have a HTTP server running in order to stream the videos (defined at `config.json`).\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat I'm working on for the next releases:\r\n\r\n * Implement authentication (login/videos access)\r\n * Treat errors\r\n * Logging\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n**stream.json** is licensed under GPLv3, which means I'll love your Feedback/Pull Requests. **:)**\r\n\r\n```\r\nstream.json - The geek's home media streaming server.\r\nCopyright (C) 2012  Nathan Campos\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
