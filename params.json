As described, this is the geek's home media streaming server, so the only thing that it does is get the video index from `videos.json` and send customized JSON for your client.\r\n\r\nThink of it as a middleware for your HTTP server to make streaming videos more customizable than just directory listings. **:)**\r\n\r\n## Clients\r\n\r\nThis is just a server so if you really want to have a great time with it I recommend you to check out these clients:\r\n\r\n- [stream_json.php](http://nathanpc.github.com/stream_json.php/)\r\n\r\nI'm going to develop clients for all major mobile platforms (iOS, Android, and BlackBerry), also I'll try to learn more about GTK+ (with Python) programming to create a Linux client.\r\n\r\nIf you want to develop a client don't forget to check [API Documentation](https://github.com/nathanpc/stream.json/wiki/API-Documentation).\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\n**stream.json** is really easy to setup (for a geek).\r\n\r\n- Create a file called `config.json` inside the `/config` folder. Here's an example (if you want to know more about the configurations file please read [Configuration-File](https://github.com/nathanpc/stream.json/wiki/Configuration-File)):\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"server_port\": 4881,\r\n  \"video_server\": {\r\n    \"local\": true,\r\n    \"ip\": \"\",\r\n    \"port\": 80,\r\n    \"suffix\": \"~Nathan/\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"auth\": {\r\n    \"required\": false,\r\n    \"users\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"username\": \"admin\",\r\n        \"password\": \"admin\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Create a file called `videos.json` in the same folder as `app.js`. This file will hold the index of movies/videos and their informations. Your `videos.json` file should look like this (if you want to know more about the video index file please read [Video-Index-File](https://github.com/nathanpc/stream.json/wiki/Video-Index-File)):\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"video\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"Unique-ID-Here\",\r\n      \"title\": \"Awesome Movie Title Here\",\r\n      \"poster\": {\r\n        \"remote\": false,\r\n        \"location\": \"/path/to/your/poster/LikeThis.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"file\": {\r\n        \"remote\": false,\r\n        \"location\": \"some_movie_name.mp4\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"description\": {\r\n        \"format\": \"plain\",\r\n        \"text\": \"Your description goes here.\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- You should have a HTTP server running in order to stream the videos (defined at `config.json`).\r\n\r\n- To start **stream.json** just run:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ nohup node app.js > output.log &\r\n```\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat I'm working on for the next releases:\r\n\r\n * Implement authentication (login/videos access)\r\n * Treat errors\r\n * Improve logging\r\n * More?\r\n\r\nIf you have a suggestion please open a Issue and I'll be pleased to implement it. Pull Requests are welcome too.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nI really appreciate people that stop to say \"Thank You\" to a developer.
